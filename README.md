# 💬 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on classifying tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It demonstrates the full workflow of preparing text data, extracting features with TF-IDF, and training a machine learning model for sentiment prediction.

## 🔍 Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopwords, mentions, URLs)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Accuracy and classification report outputs
- Prediction script for testing new tweets
- Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to help beginners understand how NLP models can turn raw text into useful sentiment insights.  
It serves as a simple and practical starting point for anyone interested in social media analysis or text classification.

> **Note:** This project uses sample tweet datasets for learning only and does not require access to Twitter’s API.
